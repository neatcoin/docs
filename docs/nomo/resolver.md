To resolve Neatcoin domains in your browser, you can use one of the
hosted DNS resolver, via DNS-over-HTTPS. Neatcoin is a decentralized
network, so it is also possible to run the resolvers yourself.

The addresses for the hosted DNS resolvers are:

* **Neatcoin mainnet**: `https://dns.neatcoin.org/dns-query`
* **Vodka testnet**: `https://vodka.dns.neatcoin.org/dns-query`

## Firefox

Follow the official guide to [enable
DNS-over-HTTPS](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-dns-over-https#w_manually-enabling-and-disabling-dns-over-https). Switch
provider to "custom", and enter the URL
`https://dns.neatcoin.org/dns-query`. You are now able to resolve
Neatcoin domain names.

## Chrome

Navigate to settings, select "privacy & security" > "security". Tick
"use secure DNS", choose "custom" provider, and enter the URL
`https://dns.neatcoin.org/dns-query`. You are now able to resolve
Neatcoin domain names.

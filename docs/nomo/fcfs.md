FCFS domains are domains registered in a first-come-first-served
basis. The `.neatuser` TLD on Neatcoin is currently registered this
way.

## Fees

FCFS domains cost 500 NEAT to register. To prevent domain name
hoarding, the domain name must be renewed each year for 500 NEAT.

This fee is controlled by on-chain governance and can be changed
later. However, existing FCFS domains maintain the property that the
renewal fee will never be higher than the last one. For example, with
the current network renewal fee being 500 NEAT, one registered a
domain. If the network renewal fee then changed to 600 NEAT, the
domain renewal fee is still 500 NEAT, for all years afterwards. If the
network renewal fee is changed to 400 NEAT, then the domain renewal
fee becomes 400 NEAT as well, for all year afterwards.

## Registration

You can use the [Neatcoin
wallet](https://wallet.neatcoin.org/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fvodka.rpc.neatcoin.org%2Fws#/domains)
to register FCFS domains.

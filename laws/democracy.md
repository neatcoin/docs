This Neatcoin Laws article describes the Neatcoin democracy module.

## Governance bodies

In Neatcoin, three different governance bodies exist.

### Users

Anyone who owns Neatcoin automatically becomes a Neatcoin User. The right is
automatic, and instant. The moment one owns Neatcoin, one can start to
participate in Neatcoin governance matters. The other two governance bodies,
council and technical committee, are directly or indirectly elected by Neatcoin
Users.

The voting right of a Neatcoin User depends on the amount of coins the User
owns. Once a User ceases to own Neatcoin, it ceases to be a Neatcoin User.

### Council

Neatcoin Council consists of 7 seats (Prime Council Members and Council
Members), 30 Runners Up, and a number of Candidates.

Council Members have equal voting rights. Runners Up and Candidates do not have
voting rights.

Council Members serve for one Council Term. A Council Term lasts 24 hours. Users
(including Council Members, Runners Up and Candidates) can choose to vote on
Council Members, Runners Up and Candidates by locking coins. Each new Council
Term, an election is held based on the Phragmen election algorithm. The first 7
elected becomes Council Members. The next 30 elected becomes Runners Up. Anyone
elected below this or have zero backing are removed. The first elected also gets
the Prime Council Member status.

All Neatcoin Users can choose to become a Candidate at any time.

### Technical Committee

Neatcoin Technical Committee consists of an arbitrary number of seats (Prime
Technical Committee Member and Technical Committee Members).

Prime Technical Committee Member and Technical Comittee Members are appointed
through Referendums.

## Governance matters

Users, Council and Technical Committee decide on different governance matters.

### Users

Users, through Referendum, can decide on all governance matters. In particular,
anything that is considered to be a Root Matter can only be decided directly by
users. Those Root Matters include:

* Conducting a runtime upgrade.
* Blacklist a proposal from being tabled again.
* Appoint Prime Technical Committee Member and Technical Committee Members.
* Appoint identity registrar.
* Decide on inflation rate.
* Decide on staking validator count.
* Other Root Matters.

### Council

Council Members, through Council Motions, can decide on a limited number of
governance matters. Those include:

* Table an external super-majority, simple-majority and simple-default
  Referendum for Users to vote on.
* Approve and disapprove treasury proposals, tips and bounties.
* Cancel a Referendum when it is in the voting phrase.
* Cancel staking slashes.
* Other governance matters Council Members can vote through Council Motions.

### Technical Committee

Technical Committee, through Technical Committee Motions, can decide on a
limited number of governance matters. Those include:

* Cancel a Referendum when it is in the proposing phrase.
* Fast-track a simple-majority and simple-default Referendum.
* Other governance matters Technical Committee Members can vote through
  Technical Committee Motions.

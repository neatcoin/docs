Neatcoin Laws is a descriptive, texted version of the Neatcoin runtime.

The goal is to provide a referential, non-introductory description of Neatcoin's
on-chain governance system, for those who don't want to or can't directly read
the code.

Neatcoin Laws is versioned. Each time when the governance system is modified in
a runtime upgrade, a new Neatcoin Laws version is created. This allows people to
keep track of what happened in the past, and what has changed.

In case of difference, the Neatcoin runtime, as the native language of the
Neatcoin governance system, always take precedence. In that case, the Neatcoin
Laws should be modified so that it adheres to the Neatcoin runtime.
